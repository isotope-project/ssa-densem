Our denotational approach uses pomsets to provide a compositional semantics capturing exactly the behaviours permitted by SPARC TSO.

  abstract  = {This paper describes LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine),a compiler framework designed to support transparent, lifelongprogram analysis and transformation for arbitrary programs,by providing high-level information to compilertransformations at compile-time, link-time, run-time, and inidle time between runs.LLVM defines a common, low-levelcode representation in Static Single Assignment (SSA) form,with several novel features: a simple, language-independenttype-system that exposes the primitives commonly used toimplement high-level language features; an instruction fortyped address arithmetic; and a simple mechanism that canbe used to implement the exception handling features ofhigh-level languages (and setjmp/longjmp in C) uniformlyand efficiently.The LLVM compiler framework and coderepresentation together provide a combination of key capabilitiesthat are important for practical, lifelong analysis andtransformation of programs.To our knowledge, no existingcompilation approach provides all these capabilities.We describethe design of the LLVM representation and compilerframework, and evaluate the design in three ways: (a) thesize and effectiveness of the representation, including thetype information it provides; (b) compiler performance forseveral interprocedural problems; and (c) illustrative examplesof the benefits LLVM provides for several challengingcompiler problems.},

MLIR addresses software fragmentation, compilation for heterogeneous hardware, significantly reducing the cost of building domain specific compilers, and connecting existing compilers together.MLIR facilitates the design and implementation of code generators, translators and optimizers at different levels of abstraction and across application domains, hardware targets and execution environments. The contribution of this work includes (1) discussion of MLIR as a research artifact, built for extension and evolution, while identifying the challenges and opportunities posed by this novel design, semantics, optimization specification, system, and engineering. (2) evaluation of MLIR as a generalized infrastructure that reduces the cost of building compilers---describing diverse use-cases to show research and educational opportunities for future programming languages, compilers, execution environments, and computer architecture. The paper also presents the rationale for MLIR, its original design principles, structures and semantics.},

  abstract   = {CompCert is a formally verified compiler that generates compact and efficient code for a large subset of the C language. However, CompCert foregoes using SSA, an intermediate representation employed by many compilers that enables writing simpler, faster optimizers. In fact, it has remained an open problem to verify formally an SSA-based compiler. We report on a formally verified, SSA-based middle-end for CompCert. In addition to providing a formally verified SSA-based middle-end, we address two problems raised by Leroy in [2009]: giving an intuitive formal semantics to SSA, and leveraging its global properties to reason locally about program optimizations.},

  abstract  = {The Gated Static Single Assignment (GSA) form was proposed by Ottenstein et al. in 1990, as an intermediate representation for implementing advanced static analyses and optimisation passes in compilers. Compared to SSA, GSA records additional data dependencies and provides more context, making optimisations more effective and allowing one to reason about programs as data-flow graphs. Many practical implementations have been proposed that follow, more or less faithfully, Ottenstein et al.'s seminal paper. But many discrepancies remain between these, depending on the kind of dependencies they are supposed to track and to leverage in analyses and code optimisations. In this paper, we present a formal semantics for GSA, mechanised in Coq. In particular, we clarify the nature and the purpose of gates in GSA, and define control-flow insensitive semantics for them. We provide a specification that can be used as a reference description for GSA. We also specify a translation from SSA to GSA and prove that this specification is semantics-preserving. We demonstrate that the approach is practical by implementing the specification as a validated translation within the CompCertSSA verified compiler.},

  abstract  = {MLIR is a novel framework for developing intermediate representations (IRs) of compilers. At its core, MLIR is a framework for the specification of syntax fragments (dialects) and optimisations, which can be combined \`{a}−la−carte to form customised IRs. Through this, MLIR allows IR abstractions to be shared across different domains. With rapid adoption of MLIR across industry, techniques for formalised semantics which matches the flexibility and extensibility offered by MLIR are urgently needed. We propose a framework for MLIR semantics based on effect handlers, which allows for dialect semantics to be specified in a modular and composable way, parallel to MLIR. We also describe several research directions continuing on from handlers-based MLIR semantics.},

We characterise MIL-lite observational congruence by using Howe's method to prove a ciu theorem for the language in terms of a termination predicate defined directly on the term. We then define a logical predicate which captures an observable version of the intended meaning of each of our effect annotations. Having proved the fundamental theorem for this predicate, we use it with the ciu theorem to validate a number of effect-based transformations performed by the MLj compiler for Standard ML.}
